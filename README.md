# cf-sh

A simple shell based on csh that can run commands, traverse directories, redirect file i/o and pipe multiple commands together.

## Usage

To run the shell as the default user
```
./cf-sh
```
To run the shell as a different user
```
./cf-sh username
```
Changing the username does not effect the actuall usage of the shell. It only changes the displayed prompt name.
